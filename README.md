## Advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript libraries/frameworks
In this course we are going to develop a singe page web app with native JavaScript. So no use of jQuery, React or other libraries and/or frameworks. Learn the actual underlying technologies, before learning abstractions. I have listed some pros and cons of using JavaScript libraries;

#### Pros
* Frameworks can provide you with a stable code base and a good set of features to begin with (but now we are going to learn those base in native JavaScript). [1]
* When your project needs to be accomplished quickly, a framework will be faster to set things up. [1]
* Most of the frameworks have a established community you can count on.  [1]
* There are some libraries that are offering something different, like D3.JS (a JavaScript library for visualizing data). [2]

#### Cons
* The number of libraries and frameworks available can be overwhelming. Vanilla JavaScript is making it much easier to choose. Plus, you only have to learn JavaScript instead of new basic principles of other libraries/frameworks.
* If your projects is a lightweight entity, you might just not even use the majority of the features and functions provided by the framework in question. Vanilla JavaScript is generally lightweight and quicker to operate as compared to frameworks.[1]
* You are independent of the updates and actions of the using framework.
* It doesn't mean that other colleagues are working with the same library/framework. For example, when you find a different company to work for it is possible that they using a different library than you are used to. You have to dive into another library again.
* Frameworks need to work for masses. Almost every product has something unique about it. And eventually there will at least be one such case that doesn't fit into the approach suggested by the framework. [3]

## Advantages and disadvantages of client-side single page web apps
A single-page application is a web application that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server.[4] This means that our website will run client side, the web browser of the user. Below some pros and cons about this way of building an application.

#### Pros
* Only the elements that were changed will be reloaded. This is good for the server, not too many things are loaded.
* Clear line between Front-end and Back-end. [5]

#### Cons
* Het traditionele internetverkeer is helemaal afgestemd op de multi page variant. Dat zie je onder andere terugkomen bij de zoekmachines: deze gaan nog uit van de traditionele herladende pagina’s en zo crawlen zij dan ook voornamelijk de door hun bezochte websites. Van Google is inmiddels bekend dat ze redelijk goed kunnen omgaan met SPA's. Mits de SPA goed is opgezet, en alle links netjes gebruik maken van een eigen URL, wordt je website gewoon gespiderd. [5]
* Omdat een SPA, in tegenstelling tot volledig herladende pagina’s, continue ‘open’ blijft staan, moet je als ontwikkelaar plots ook weer gaan letten op geheugengebruik. Het geheugen kan vollopen, want dit wordt niet bij elke nieuwe pagina weer geleegd. [5]
